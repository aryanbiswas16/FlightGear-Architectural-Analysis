# FlightGear Architecture Analysis Project

This repository contains three reports analyzing the architecture of FlightGear for the CISC 322/362 class. FlightGear is an open-source flight simulator developed for multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The analysis focuses on understanding the conceptual architecture, concrete architecture, and architectural enhancements of FlightGear.

## Reports

1. **Conceptual Architecture of FlightGear**
   - Provides a high-level conceptual overview of FlightGear's architecture.
   - Discusses the key concepts, components, and interactions in FlightGear's architecture.
   - Includes diagrams and illustrations to visualize the conceptual architecture.

2. **Concrete Architecture of FlightGear**
   - Provides a detailed analysis of the concrete architecture of FlightGear.
   - Discusses the implementation details of FlightGear's components and their interactions.
   - Includes code snippets and examples to illustrate the concrete architecture.

3. **Architectural Enhancements of FlightGear**
   - Discusses potential architectural enhancements to FlightGear.
   - Analyzes how these enhancements could improve the performance, extensibility, or user experience of FlightGear.
   - Includes a discussion on the feasibility and potential challenges of implementing these enhancements.
